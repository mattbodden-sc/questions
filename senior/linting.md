### **Coding Challenge: The Warehouse Robot's Linting Disaster**

#### **Story:**

In the bustling warehouse of **RoboLogix Inc.**, the state-of-the-art warehouse robot, **DalliBot 3000**, was designed to revolutionize package sorting. It was supposed to be the pinnacle of automationâ€”until a **critical bug** in its code caused a catastrophic failure.  

The bug? A **linting issue** in the robot's codebase left unmatched braces in its sorting algorithm. This oversight caused DalliBot 3000 to scramble the packages instead of sorting them by their arrival date. Now, urgent packages are buried under less critical ones, and the entire warehouse is in **chaos**.  

The warehouse manager, **Mr. Stackwell**, has tasked you with creating a **Brace Validator** to ensure such a disaster never happens again. Your tool will scan through the robot's code and identify any unmatched or improperly nested braces, helping the developers fix the issue before deploying the robot's next update.

---

### **Task:**

- Write a program that validates a string of code to ensure:
  1. Every **opening brace** (`(`, `{`, `[`) has a corresponding **closing brace** (`)`, `}`, `]`).
  2. Braces are **properly nested** (e.g., `{[()]}` is valid, but `{[(])}` is not).

---

### **Requirements:**

1. Implement a class called `BraceValidator`, you can implement any methods you need, but it must have the following method:
   - `validate(code)`: Validates the string of code and returns:
     - `True` if the braces are balanced and properly nested.
     - A descriptive error message if there is a mismatch or missing brace.

2. Handle edge cases, such as:
   - Empty strings (should return `True`).
   - Strings with no braces (should return `True`).
   - Strings with mismatched or missing braces.

### **Example Input and Output:**

#### **Input 1:**
```python
code = "(let x = {y: [1, 2, 3]})"
```
### **Output 1:**
```python
True
```
### **Input 2:**
```python
code = "(let x = {y: [1, 2, 3})"
```
### **Output 2:**
```python
"} has a mismatched opening brace"
```
### **Input 3:**
```python
code = "(let x = {y: [1, 2, 3]}"
```
### **Output 3:**
```python
"( doesn't have a closing brace"
```

By solving this challenge, you'll ensure that **DalliBot 3000** never suffers from another linting disaster, restoring order to the warehouse and saving the day!
